# The Vista Library for Kubernetes

Popular applications, provided by Vista, ready to launch on Kubernetes using Kubernetes Helm.

## TL;DR

```bash
helm repo add vista https://yidaqiang.github.io/helm-charts
helm search repo vista
helm install my-release vista/<chart>
```

## Before you begin

### Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.23+
- Helm 3.8.0+

### Install Helm

Helm is a tool for managing Kubernetes charts. Charts are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.

To install Helm, refer to the [Helm install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm#install) and ensure that the `helm` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Using Helm

Once you have installed the Helm client, you can deploy a Bitnami Helm Chart into a Kubernetes cluster.

Please refer to the [Quick Start guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) if you wish to get running in just a few commands, otherwise, the [Using Helm Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/using_helm/) provides detailed instructions on how to use the Helm client to manage packages on your Kubernetes cluster.

Useful Helm Client Commands:

- Install a chart: `helm install my-release vista/<chart>`
- Upgrade your application: `helm upgrade my-release vista/<chart>`
